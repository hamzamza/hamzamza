I'm a software engineering student with a passion for mobile development and full-stack development. I'm currently working with Flutter, and I have a good knowledge of Kotlin and Java for Android development. For the backend, I'm using Node.js and Express.js. I also have experience with web development using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. 

In addition to my frontend and backend skills, I have a strong foundation in data structures using C and C++. I also have experience working with SQL and NoSQL databases, including MongoDB, SQLite, and Hive database for Flutter.
